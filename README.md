# perfect_love_app

A new flutter application which is developing for my final bachelor project.
After my final proposal I have plan to put it on markets and work more on its business plans , Thank you in advance for your contributions :)

<b>Features</b>
1. Evaluating how much a relationship is healthy or not by proposing some questions
2. Connect a therapist to people who needs help of a therapist and they can make reservations.

Those were the core features of my flutter app and I know it still needs more implementations and improvements so please let me know your ideas , I really appreciate it and it means a world to me.
